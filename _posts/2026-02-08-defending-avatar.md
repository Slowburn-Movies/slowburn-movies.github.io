It's all too common for film fanatics to look down their noses at Avatar. I understand. They put these movies in the same bucket as superhero blockbuster slop.

However, what are such people to think when renowned American filmmaker Michael Mann [recently named](https://variety.com/lists/directors-favorite-films-2025/avatar-fire-and-ash/) Avatar: Fire and Ash his favorite film of 2025? Mann said the following:

> Jim began with a blank piece of paper. No writer-director I can think of has invented as large a three-dimensional world of his own imagining as has Jim. “Fire and Ash” on its own is an incredible achievement. There are two more installments to come. From some point in the future, when regarded historically, the whole of “Avatar” will be seen as the magnum opus it truly is.

At the very least, this should give us pause.

## The Spectacle

Isn't Avatar just a big technology spectacle? Isn't it just meant to dazzle? Well, yes. Jim likes to push the boundaries with new technology. But people forget that film has always been about giving people new experiences with new technology. Jim's theory behind this is that if we want audiences to see movies in theaters, we need to make movies worth seeing in theaters. Film is fundamentally visual, afterall. But there is a lot more under the surface of this spectacle.

## My Experience

I saw Avatar much later than its original release date of 2009. I was too busy with my freshman year of college to make time for a Fern Gully knock-off. One Summer day in 2012, when I was working on the packing line at a furniture factory, my Jugallo co-worker told me about how much he loved this movie. The next day he brought me the DVD from his collection. When my shift ended at 10pm, I cracked open the Barefoot Moscato and put it on my 27" CRT fullscreen living room television.

I couldn't explain it then, but I was astounded by what I saw. This was back before smartphones, so looking at your phone during a movie was a non-issue. Regardless, I was engrossed in the story. I told my coworker how much I loved the movie and really just left it at that.

A decade later, Avatar: Way of Water came out. For whatever reason, the same thing happened where this whole event just passed me by. The only thing I remember seeing from it was the memes about the tacticool military Na'vi and the little children that have strangely modern Zoomer-style haircuts.

Fast forward again three years and Avatar: Fire and Ash comes out. Youtube recommended me a slew of behind the scenes footage along with James Cameron interviews nerding out about the technology behind it all. I have to admit that I got interested in this in an ironic way at first. "Yes," I thought, "Avatar is the best thing ever and I'm going to see the new one." We know how it goes, though. Irony gives way to sincerity. 

I sat down and watched Avatar (2009) and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) back-to-back to get ready for the new one. When you approach things from an ironic standpoint, you have an immense suspension of disbelief. It was this suspension that allowed me to become fully engrossed in what I was seeing. The thought of "what if it's bad" or "what if it's cheesy" never crossed my mind. I was just completely receptive to the journey on which Cameron wanted to take me. I was blown away with how much Way of Water expanded the world and characters. And the actors' performances were as award-worthy as any other drama I've seen.

## Auteur Theory

As a longtime fan of Titanic, something finally clicked with me. [James Cameron is an auteur (author)](https://visionpersistence.wordpress.com/2015/03/07/james-cameron-the-auteur/).

Avatar, more than any other project, allows for a truly auteur filmmaking process. I say this because there are zero limitations in the creative process. You can put a camera anywhere, you can block the characters in any way you want. Jim has full creative license to make the exact film that he wants to author. Even directors like Truffaut had physical limitations in that regard. An inexperienced filmmaker would be terrified of this situation. 

We often rely on limitations to bring out our own creative voice. But in Auteur Theory, we liken the filmmaker to an author. There is no limitation for an author as to what goes on a page. The only limit is the author's imagination. In this sense, the technology behind Avatar allows Jim to be a true author. 

## American Anime

The closest medium to which we can liken Avatar would be pure animation. There are also no limitations there. And in the world of Japanese Anime, there are even less because of the amount of freedom that these creators have.

I believe that the Avatar movies are the closest thing to authentic American Anime that we have. 

Not many people know that Guillermo Del Toro and James Cameron are essentially brothers. They lived together in LA in the 90s. Del Toro has said that he and Jim would spend many hours watching anime together. Del Toro [summed up his love for Avatar like this](https://youtu.be/T0NGBCzF1JY?si=sb5xuBz2k1-_Tgfd&t=390):  

> There are very few Americans that have created a full mythology. You have (George) Lucas, the whole Wizard of Oz mythology with Frank Baum, and Jim is creating that with Avatar. It's gonna take you places.

## In Sum

Approaching a movie with an ironic abandon isn't a bad thing. It can be a great tool for self-forgetfulness. We need to forget ourselves to fully immerse in a truly imaginative story. When you do so with Avatar, I think you'll be surprised with how you come away from it.

If I, or Michael Mann, or Guillermo Del Toro, have inspired you to go back and watch these movies again, do so with new eyes. Think less "superhero slop" and more "psycho-sexual fever dream". Let it wash over you.
