It's all too common for film fanatics to look down their noses at the Avatar films. They put it in the same bucket as the Marvel movies or the Transformers franchise.

However, what are such people to think when renowned American filmmaker Michael Mann [recently named](https://variety.com/lists/directors-favorite-films-2025/avatar-fire-and-ash/) Avatar: Fire and Ash his favorite film of 2025. Mann said the following:

> Jim began with a blank piece of paper. No writer-director I can think of has invented as large a three-dimensional world of his own imagining as has Jim. “Fire and Ash” on its own is an incredible achievement. There are two more installments to come. From some point in the future, when regarded historically, the whole of “Avatar” will be seen as the magnum opus it truly is.

Should movie buffs rethink how they classify these movies?

I saw Avatar much later than its original release date of 2009. I was too busy with my freshman year of college to make time for a Fern Gully knock-off. One Summer day in 2012, when I was working on the packing line at the furniture factory, my Jugallo co-worker told me about how much he loved this movie. The next day he brought me the DVD from his collection. When my shift ended at 10pm, I cracked open the Barefoot Moscato and put it on my 27" CRT fullscreen living room television.

I couldn't explain it then, but I was astounded by what I saw. This was back before smartphones, so looking at your phone during a movie was a non-issue. Regardless, I was engrossed in the story. I told my coworker how much I loved the movie and really just left it at that.

A decade later, Avatar: Way of Water came out. For whatever reason, the same thing happened where this whole event just passed me by. The only thing I remember seeing from it is the memes about the tacticool military Na'vi and the little children that have strangely modern Zoomer-style haircuts.

Fast forward again three years later and Avatar: Fire and Ash comes out. Youtube recommended me a slew of behind the scenes footage along with James Cameron interviews nerding out about the technology behind it all. I have to admit that I got interested in this in an ironic way at first. "Yes," I thought, "Avatar is the best thing ever and I'm going to see the new one." We know how it goes, though. Irony gives way to sincerity. 

I sat down and watched Avatar (2009) and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) back-to-back to get ready for the new one. 

I was blown away with how much Way of Water expanded the world and characters. The actors' performances were as award-worthy as any other drama I've seen.

As a longtime fan of Titanic, something finally clicked with me. [James Cameron is an auteur filmmaker](https://visionpersistence.wordpress.com/2015/03/07/james-cameron-the-auteur/).

I understand why people overlook these movies. I, myself, did it twice. 

But if I, or Michael Mann, have inspired you to go back and watch these movies again, do so with new eyes. Think less "superhero slop" and more "psycho-sexual fever dream". Let it wash over you.
