It's all too common for film fanatics to look down their noses at Avatar. I understand. They mentally put these movies in the same bucket as superhero blockbuster slop. However, in recent times, critically acclaimed filmmakers have come out of the woodwork praising not just the first Avatar film, but also the latest entry, Fire and Ash.

For example, Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, Collateral, The Last of the Mohicans) [recently named](https://variety.com/lists/directors-favorite-films-2025/avatar-fire-and-ash/) Avatar: Fire and Ash his favorite film of 2025. Mann said the following:

> Jim began with a blank piece of paper. No writer-director I can think of has invented as large a three-dimensional world of his own imagining as has Jim. “Fire and Ash” on its own is an incredible achievement. There are two more installments to come. From some point in the future, when regarded historically, the whole of “Avatar” will be seen as the magnum opus it truly is.

At the very least, this should give us pause.

## The Spectacle

Isn't Avatar just a big technology spectacle? Isn't it just meant to dazzle? Well, yes. The director of the films, James Cameron, likes to push the boundaries with new technology. But people forget that film has always been about giving the audience new experiences with new technology. When motion pictures were first invented, no doubt there were art snobs that saw it as an spectacle that was meant to dazzle and nothing more. Twenty-four frames per second, the dolly, the steadycam, 3D, so it goes.

Jim's theory behind this is that if we want audiences to see movies in theaters, we need to make movies worth seeing in theaters. Film is fundamentally visual, after all. So seemingly, the real concern from movie buffs is that there is nothing *beyond* the spectacle; nothing under the surface.

## My Experience

I saw Avatar much later than its original release date of 2009. I was too busy with my freshman year of college to make time for a "Fern Gully knock-off". One Summer day in 2012, when I was working on the packing line at a furniture factory, my Juggalo co-worker told me about how much he loved this movie. The next day he brought me the DVD from his collection. When my shift ended at 10pm, I cracked open the Barefoot Moscato and put it on my 27" CRT fullscreen living room television.

I couldn't explain it then, but I was astounded by what I saw. This was back before I had a smartphone, so my attention span was a non-issue. Regardless, I was engrossed in the story. Nevertheless, I told my coworker how much I loved the movie and really just left it at that.

A decade later, Avatar: Way of Water came out. For whatever reason, the same thing happened where this whole event just passed me by. Fast forward again three years and Avatar: Fire and Ash comes out. Youtube recommended me a slew of behind the scenes footage along with James Cameron interviews nerding out about the technology behind it all. I have to admit that I got interested in this in an ironic way at first. "Yes," I thought, "Avatar is the best thing ever and I'm going to see the new one." We know how it goes, though. Irony gives way to sincerity. 

I sat down and watched Avatar (2009) and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) back-to-back to get ready for the new one. When you approach things from an ironic standpoint, you have an immense suspension of disbelief. It was this suspension that allowed me to become fully engrossed in what I was seeing. The thought of "what if it's bad" or "what if it's cheesy" never crossed my mind. I was just completely receptive to the journey on which Cameron wanted to take me. 

It struck me then how the whole concept of the story is so unique. Humans need to become friends with the native beings so they grow lifeless husks of these beings and pilot them with their consciousness. Oh, and it turns out that these beings are also very sexy.

It's so preposterous that it becomes compelling again. "How could someone actually write this story," one thinks. 

Beyond the basic concept behind the story, I was genuinely impressed by the actors' performances. The dialogue is simple and direct while also managing to be memorable. It's borderline pulp; that is to say, it's actually fun. And similar to Star Wars, the actors more than 'make do'. They own it. It's been a long time since I had dialogue "earworms" stuck in my head. I'm still saying "You're like a baby" in Neytiri's voice months later.

Bradley Cooper (A Star is Born, Maestro, Silver Linings Playbook) recently [went on a rant about his love for the Avatar series](https://youtu.be/slYfiSb5AX4?t=8275), saying the following:

> I saw a movie the other night that I didn't believe anybody in it. But I love Avatar. We watched 3, then 2, then 1. I had just gone from watching this movie where I didn't believe anything anybody was doing; the whole time. Then I'm watching Avatar for 2 seconds and they're on a thing and they're blue, but they're talking to each other ... By the way I'm like, when's 4 and 5?

Cooper is also shocked by how utterly believable these performances are despite being high fantasy-sci-fi.

In the Way of Water, the world and lore expands tenfold. Now having older children himself, Cameron writes a family drama from a view of experience. The underlying strained relationships between husband and wife, parents and children; thinking back, it's all evident from the family portrait in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

I've never seen water look so good in a movie before.  

Fire and Ash can really be thought of as Part 2 of the Way of Water. Originally, it was just one script. Cameron later split the script into two. When thought of this way, I think Fire and Ash is an excellent installment. The characters play in the same sandbox, so the focus is much more on the story and drama this time around. 

There is one 2 second clip in Fire and Ash that made me realize that Cameron is actually willing to get weird with this. 

In terms of courage in storytelling and freedom of creativity, I believe that the Avatar movies are the closest thing to authentic American Anime that we have. 

Not many people know that Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, Frankenstein) and James Cameron lived together in LA in the 90s. Del Toro has said that he and Jim would spend many hours watching anime together. Del Toro [summed up his love for Avatar like this](https://youtu.be/T0NGBCzF1JY?si=sb5xuBz2k1-_Tgfd&t=390):  

> There are very few Americans that have created a full mythology. You have (George) Lucas, the whole Wizard of Oz mythology with Frank Baum, and Jim is creating that with Avatar. It's gonna take you places.

## Auteur Theory

As a longtime fan of Titanic, something finally clicked with me. [James Cameron is an auteur](https://visionpersistence.wordpress.com/2015/03/07/james-cameron-the-auteur/). Auteur filmmaking is a theory of film analysis that says the filmmaker is similar to the author of a book. You can see recurring themes and devices across the body of the filmmakers' work because they have the skill to manifest these things in their projects. For Cameron, it's the hubris of human achievement against the sheer power of nature. It's the white picket fence fantasy of family vs its messy reality. It's tactile blue-collar environments full of buttons and switches and knobs and hoses. 

Despite there being wildly different technical contexts across all of Cameron's films, he maintains a consistent vision and voice. Technologically, Avatar is a blank canvas for Cameron. And yet, what he produces is the most Cameron film yet, harkening back to all 

There are visuals in these movies that no one has ever seen before. They are so novel, so inventive and stimulating, that you will certainly go into a depression after seeing them.


## In Sum

Approaching a movie with an ironic abandon isn't a bad thing. It can be a great tool for self-forgetfulness. We need to forget ourselves to fully immerse in a truly imaginative story. When you do so with Avatar, I think you'll be surprised with how you come away from it.

If I, or Michael Mann, or Bradley Cooper, or Guillermo Del Toro have inspired you to go back and watch these movies again, do so with new eyes. Let it wash over you.
