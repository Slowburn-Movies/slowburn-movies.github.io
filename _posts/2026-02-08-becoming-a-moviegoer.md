Going to the movie theater is special today, but it isn't as special as it could be.

Most people today have home theater setups that rival the visual or sonic fidelity of a theater. But one thing that can never be competed with is the fact that when you're in a theater, you're a captive audience. You don't have control. You either sit there or you walk out.

Psychologically, this is a powerful situation for a viewer. 

I recently saw [The Fellowship of the Ring in theaters](https://www.fathomentertainment.com/news/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-25th-anniversary-event-rings-up-11m-in-worldwide-box-office/). I've seen this movie probably 40 times since I was 11 years old, but I never saw it in the theaters. I expected the theatrical experience to be visually impressive, but I was mostly surprised by something else. I felt real fear. When watching a movie with any kind of horror or thrill to it at home, there's always the option to pause, fast forward, etc. Because there is always this escape hatch, things are just less scary at home. Even horror as mild as Lord of the Rings gets ratcheted up in the theater though.

Typically, people reserve the theaters for a massive film like [Avatar](/defending-avatar), but they'll watch most other movies at home. I think this bifurcation is a mistake. Watching movies at home, no matter how nice your setup is, is robbing yourself of a deeper experience. If you don't feel like you're strapped into the Clockwork Orange chair, are you really open to having an experience?

Okay, so how do you become a true Moviegoer? How do you ween off of the home theater experience and start going to the theater more often? Thankfully it's easier than ever.

## Get a Membership

One good thing that has come from the decline in box office sales is it has forced movie theater chains to come up with more customer-centric solutions. Pretty much all chains now have some equivalent to a monthly membership that is an insanely good deal for customers.

AMC A-List. Regal Unlimited. Cinemark Movie Club.

Great. You're seeing movies at least once a week. You're seeing releases of older movies in theaters, you're seeing the latest indie drama in theaters, and of course you're keeping up with the biggest blockbusters. 

If you're with me so far, strap in for this next part.

## Get a Tiny TV

Downgrade your home theater. Get rid of your amazing 80" OLED TV. Get rid of your sound system. Swap this for a small CRT or something.

Similar to the nuclear option of replacing your iPhone with a 'dumbphone', this is the nuclear option to really force yourself to try something different.

## Surprising Benefits

You're getting out of the house. Remember [Third Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)?

You're having shared experiences.
