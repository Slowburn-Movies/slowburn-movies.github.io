Two Sleepy People is a testament to the sheer willpower and determination of creative people attempting to break into the film world. Written in two weeks, filmed in under 100 days, self-funded, and distributed to more theaters than I ever thought was possible for such a small, nascent indie studio- it’s a miracle this was ever distributed at all. It’s a film that punches far above its weight, naturally flowing through its humor and emotionality, and it proudly and nostalgically wears its influences on its sleeve. 

The film harkens back to the simpler, insular emotionality of early mumblecore films of the early ‘00s (“Harmony and Me”, “The Puffy Chair”), but (surprisingly) also manages to blend in the high production value and dreamy stylings of Michel Gondry’s films, namely, “Eternal Sunshine” and “The Science of Sleep”. 

It’s a film about finding oneself in adulthood, against all odds of ever changing, in the hopes of finding happiness- even if it’s hard to let go of the life you’ve already built. It also pleasantly subverts some long standing indie film conventions around the “romantic comedy”, delving more into existential issues in a charming, theatrical style, at some points even managing to be a funny, charming, indie version of “A Marriage Story”, if you can believe that. 

Actors Baron Ryan and Caroline Grossman do a fantastic job of bringing to life some truly relatable mid-to-late-20-something’s going through a surreal dream state that forces them to face their fears. For first time actors (aside from their sizable social media presence), they more than proved their ability to act, and I think both of them could become indie darlings just from their performances here alone. This is only further justified by the fact that much of the film was improvised, although you can’t tell at all due to their natural chemistry on screen. 

Fantastic, pragmatic use of space and set design makes the film feel grounded in reality without ever feeling cheap, and there is a fantastic aesthetic, cinematographic and directorial clarity and consistency to the film that is incredibly difficult with low-budget indies. The filmmakers knew what they wanted, and utilized the budget masterfully to achieve a production value, which again, punches far, far beyond its weight. 

As someone who has always loved true independent productions, this production model and what was achieved here should be an inspiration for all prospective filmmakers out there with no major studio connections. Just like in the film, anything is possible in dreams.
